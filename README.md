# Regularization with Deep Learning
This repository presents some of the basic techniques used for optimizating/regularizing deep neural network with PyTorch. Techniques presented: Early Stopping, Weight Decay, Noise Injection, Dropout and Small Network.

It also includes a simple Movie Recommender system with the above mentioned techniques.
